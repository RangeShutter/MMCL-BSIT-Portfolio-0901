# MEMORANDUM

**To:** MotoTech Data Solution   
**From:** Ransel Sumatra, Team Leader   
**Date:** March 18, 2025   
**Subject:** Decision on Approach for Payroll System Project   

---

### **Purpose**
This memo outlines the decision on the approach we will take for our terminal assessment project, the Payroll System, and explains the reasoning behind this decision.

---

### **Decision**
We will **begin by hardcoding the data** directly into our Java program. This means storing employee details, salaries, and other necessary information within the code using arrays, lists, or objects. This approach will allow us to focus on mastering the **core programming concepts** covered in our Computer Programming 1 course, such as variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, and object-oriented programming.  

By starting with hardcoded data, we can:  
1. Build a strong foundation in Java programming.  
2. Ensure the core logic of the payroll system (e.g., salary calculations, deductions, etc.) is fully functional.  
3. Simplify debugging and testing during the initial stages of development.  

Once the core system is complete and fully functional, we will **optionally explore integrating Apache POI or Google Sheets** to make the system more dynamic and data-driven. This extension will allow us to gain exposure to external libraries and APIs, which are valuable skills for real-world applications. However, this will be treated as a secondary goal, depending on our progress and time availability.  

---

### **Additional Notes**
However, I believe that **Apache POI is more suited for our next subject (Computer Programming 2)** in the upcoming terms. Do not be discouraged if other groups appear more advanced by using tools like Apache POI or APIs to link Google Sheets to Java. Many of them rely heavily on AI bots and chat assistants to achieve their goals, which may not fully reflect their understanding of the fundamentals.  

For us, it is crucial to **fully grasp the basics and fundamental programming concepts** taught in our CAMU materials. I do not recommend going too advanced at this stage because not all of us have mastered every area of computer programming. Remember, we are still in **Computer Programming 1**, and our primary goal is to build a solid foundation.  

If we become groupmates again next term for **Computer Programming 2**, we can then explore using Apache POI or any other API to link Google Sheets to Java. By then, we will have a stronger understanding of the basics, making it easier to tackle more advanced topics.  

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Focus on developing the core functionality of the payroll system using hardcoded data.  
2. Ensure the system is well-documented, easy to understand, and maintainable.  
3. Optionally explore advanced features (e.g., Apache POI integration) if time permits.

I hope we all understand and agree with this approach. Letâ€™s work together to make this project a success!
